abstract = {The impact of female reproductive success on the mating system, gene flow, and genetic diversity of the filial generation was studied using a random sample of 801 bulk seed from a 49-clone Pseudotsuga menziesii seed orchard. We used microsatellite DNA fingerprinting and pedigree reconstruction to assign each seed's maternal and paternal parents and directly estimated clonal reproductive success, selfing rate, and the proportion of seed sired by outside pollen sources. Unlike most family array mating system and gene flow studies conducted on natural and experimental populations, which used an equal number of seeds per maternal genotype and thus generating unbiased inferences only on male reproductive success, the random sample we used was a representative of the entire seed crop; therefore, provided a unique opportunity to draw unbiased inferences on both female and male reproductive success variation. Selfing rate and the number of seed sired by outside pollen sources were found to be a function of female fertility variation. This variation also substantially and negatively affected female effective population size. Additionally, the results provided convincing evidence that the use of clone size as a proxy to fertility is questionable and requires further consideration.},

abstract = {Pollination dynamics was studied in a Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco) seed orchard using 8 nuclear microsatellite markers and pedigree reconstruction. The seed orchard consisted of 49 parents (clones). Cone-crop management included bloom delay and supplemental mass pollination (SMP) using 12 internal and 4 external pollen donors. A random sample of 801 bulk seeds was genotyped for both haploid megagametophyte and corresponding diploid embryo. Using the parental population's multilocus genotypes, full pedigree reconstruction generated all the information needed to estimate the maternal, paternal, and parental reproductive success, selfing, pollen contamination, and pollination success of the 4 external pollen donors. Maternal, paternal, and parental reproductive success varied with 80{\{}{\%}{\}} of gametes being produced by 23, 45, and 37{\{}{\%}{\}} of the orchard's parents, respectively, resulting in a drastically reduced effective population size as compared to the census number (14 vs. 53). Selfing, pollen contamination, and aggregate SMP success (internal and external) were estimated to be 15.2, 10.4, and 15.0{\{}{\%}{\}}, respectively. Full pedigree reconstruction was effective in unraveling the orchard's pollination dynamics and both female and male reproductive success.},

@article{Funda2011,
abstract = {Seed orchards' parental reproductive success is often assessed through surveys of seed-and pollen-cone production (reproductive investment). Although the reliability of this approach has been questioned, its speed and ease made it the method of choice for providing approximate estimates for the genetic quality and quantity of seed orchard crops. In this study, reproductive investment data from various female and male phenotypic assessment methods from three seed orchards (lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex. Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), and western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.)) were compared with reproductive success estimates based on DNA fingerprinting and parentage analyses. The use of reproductive investment as a proxy to reproductive success on estimating seed crop's volume genetic worth and diversity (measured by effective number of parents) was evaluated. Regression analyses indicated that the phenotypic assessment methods reflect the true parental reproductive success and that estimates of seed-and pollen-cone volume production appear to be the most appropriate indicators of female and male reproductive success, respectively. Although the best combination of female-male survey methods produced inflated effective number of parents estimates, the genetic worth estimates were similar to those based on DNA, highlighting their robustness to fertility variation assessment.},

An understanding of forest genetics is essential for providing insight into the evolution, conservation, management and sustainability of both natural and managed forests. Providing a comprehensive introduction to the principles of genetics as important to forest trees, this text integrates the varied sub-disciplines of genetics and their applications in gene conservation, tree improvement and biotechnology. Topics discussed include genetic variation in natural forest trees, the application of genetics in tree improvement and breeding programs, and genomic sciences and molecular technologies.},

abstract = {The major aim of crop variety evaluation is to predict the future performance of varieties. This paper presents the routine statistical analysis of data from late-stage testing of crop varieties in Australia. It uses a two-stage approach for analysis. The data from individual trials from the current year are analysed using spatial techniques. The resultant table of variety-by-trial means is combined with tables from previous years to form the data for an overall mixed model analysis. Weights allow for the data being estimates with varying accuracy. In view of the predictive aim of the analysis, variety effects and interactions are regarded as random effects. Appropriate inferential tools have been developed to assist with interpretation of the results. Analyses must be conducted in a timely manner so that variety predictions can be published and disseminated to growers immediately after harvest each year. Factors which facilitate this include easy access to historic data and the use of specialist mixed model software.},
