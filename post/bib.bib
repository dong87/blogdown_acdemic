abstract = {Seed orchards' parental reproductive success is often assessed through surveys of seed-and pollen-cone production (reproductive investment). Although the reliability of this approach has been questioned, its speed and ease made it the method of choice for providing approximate estimates for the genetic quality and quantity of seed orchard crops. In this study, reproductive investment data from various female and male phenotypic assessment methods from three seed orchards (lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex. Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), and western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.)) were compared with reproductive success estimates based on DNA fingerprinting and parentage analyses. The use of reproductive investment as a proxy to reproductive success on estimating seed crop's volume genetic worth and diversity (measured by effective number of parents) was evaluated. Regression analyses indicated that the phenotypic assessment methods reflect the true parental reproductive success and that estimates of seed-and pollen-cone volume production appear to be the most appropriate indicators of female and male reproductive success, respectively. Although the best combination of female-male survey methods produced inflated effective number of parents estimates, the genetic worth estimates were similar to those based on DNA, highlighting their robustness to fertility variation assessment.},

abstract = {Winner of a 2009 Outstanding Academic Title (OAT) award Trees continue to maintain a unique significance in the social, ecological and economic systems of the world - as large, long-lived perennials covering 30{\%} of land on Earth; their very nature dictates their importance. An understanding of forest genetics is essential for providing insight into the evolution, conservation, management and sustainability of both natural and managed forests. Providing a comprehensive introduction to the principles of genetics as important to forest trees, this text integrates the varied sub-disciplines of genetics and their applications in gene conservation, tree improvement and biotechnology. Topics discussed include genetic variation in natural forest trees, the application of genetics in tree improvement and breeding programs, and genomic sciences and molecular technologies.},

abstract = {The major aim of crop variety evaluation is to predict the future performance of varieties. This paper presents the routine statistical analysis of data from late-stage testing of crop varieties in Australia. It uses a two-stage approach for analysis. The data from individual trials from the current year are analysed using spatial techniques. The resultant table of variety-by-trial means is combined with tables from previous years to form the data for an overall mixed model analysis. Weights allow for the data being estimates with varying accuracy. In view of the predictive aim of the analysis, variety effects and interactions are regarded as random effects. Appropriate inferential tools have been developed to assist with interpretation of the results. Analyses must be conducted in a timely manner so that variety predictions can be published and disseminated to growers immediately after harvest each year. Factors which facilitate this include easy access to historic data and the use of specialist mixed model software.},
