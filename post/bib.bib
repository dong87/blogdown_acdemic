abstract = {Genomic-enabled prediction is becoming increasingly important in animal and plant breeding and is also receiving attention in human genetics. Deriving accurate predictions of complex traits requires implementing whole-genome regression (WGR) models where phenotypes are regressed on thousands of markers concurrently. Methods exist that allow implementing these large-p with small-n regressions, and genome-enabled selection (GS) is being implemented in several plant and animal breeding programs. The list of available methods is long, and the relationships between them have not been fully addressed. In this article we provide an overview of available methods for implementing parametric WGR models, discuss selected topics that emerge in applications, and present a general discussion of lessons learned from simulation and empirical data analysis in the last decade.},

abstract = {Genome-wide prediction of complex traits has become increasingly important in animal and plant breeding, and is receiving increasing attention in human genetics. Most common approaches are whole-genome regression models where phenotypes are regressed on thousands of markers concurrently, applying different prior distributions to marker effects. While use of shrinkage or regularization in SNP regression models has delivered improvements in predictive ability in genome-based evaluations, serious over-fitting problems may be encountered as the ratio between markers and available phenotypes continues increasing. Machine learning is an alternative approach for prediction and classification, capable of dealing with the dimensionality problem in a computationally flexible manner. In this article we provide an overview of non-parametric and machine learning methods used in genome wide prediction, discuss their similarities as well as their relationship to some well-known parametric approaches. Although the most suitable method is usually case dependent, we suggest the use of support vector machines and random forests for classification problems, whereas Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces regression and boosting may suit better regression problems, with the former having the more consistently higher predictive ability. Neural Networks may suffer from over-fitting and may be too computationally demanded when the number of neurons is large.We further discuss on the metrics used to evaluate predictive ability in model comparison under cross-validation from a genomic selection point of view. We suggest use of predictive mean squared error as a main but not only metric for model comparison. Visual tools may greatly assist on the choice of the most accurate model. {\textcopyright} 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

@article{Wu2009b,
abstract = {MOTIVATION: In ordinary regression, imposition of a lasso penalty makes continuous model selection straightforward. Lasso penalized regression is particularly advantageous when the number of predictors far exceeds the number of observations. METHOD: The present article evaluates the performance of lasso penalized logistic regression in case-control disease gene mapping with a large number of SNPs (single nucleotide polymorphisms) predictors. The strength of the lasso penalty can be tuned to select a predetermined number of the most relevant SNPs and other predictors. For a given value of the tuning constant, the penalized likelihood is quickly maximized by cyclic coordinate ascent. Once the most potent marginal predictors are identified, their two-way and higher order interactions can also be examined by lasso penalized logistic regression. RESULTS: This strategy is tested on both simulated and real data. Our findings on coeliac disease replicate the previous SNP results and shed light on possible interactions among the SNPs. AVAILABILITY: The software discussed is available in Mendel 9.0 at the UCLA Human Genetics web site. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

@incollection{Lorenz2011,
abstract = {"Genomic selection," the ability to select for even complex, quantitative traits based on marker data alone, has arisen from the conjunction of new high-throughput marker technologies and new statistical methods needed to analyze the data. This review surveys what is known about these technologies, with sections on population and quantitative genetic background, DNA marker development, statistical methods, reported accuracies of genomic selection (GS) predictions, prediction of nonadditive genetic effects, prediction in the presence of subpopulation structure, and impacts of GS on long-term gain. GS works by estimating the effects of many loci spread across the genome. Marker and observation numbers therefore need to scale with the genetic map length in Morgans and with the effective population size of the population under GS. For typical crops, the requirements range from at least 200 to at most 10,000 markers and observations. With that baseline, GS can greatly accelerate the breeding cycle while also using marker information to maintain genetic diversity and potentially prolong gain beyond what is possible with phenotypic selection. With the costs of marker technologies continuing to decline and the statistical methods becoming more routine, the results reviewed here suggest that GS will play a large role in the plant breeding of the future. Our summary and interpretation should prove useful to breeders as they assess the value of GS in the context of their populations and resources. {\{}{\textcopyright}{\}} 2011 Elsevier Inc.},

abstract = {The impact of female reproductive success on the mating system, gene flow, and genetic diversity of the filial generation was studied using a random sample of 801 bulk seed from a 49-clone Pseudotsuga menziesii seed orchard. We used microsatellite DNA fingerprinting and pedigree reconstruction to assign each seed's maternal and paternal parents and directly estimated clonal reproductive success, selfing rate, and the proportion of seed sired by outside pollen sources. Unlike most family array mating system and gene flow studies conducted on natural and experimental populations, which used an equal number of seeds per maternal genotype and thus generating unbiased inferences only on male reproductive success, the random sample we used was a representative of the entire seed crop; therefore, provided a unique opportunity to draw unbiased inferences on both female and male reproductive success variation. Selfing rate and the number of seed sired by outside pollen sources were found to be a function of female fertility variation. This variation also substantially and negatively affected female effective population size. Additionally, the results provided convincing evidence that the use of clone size as a proxy to fertility is questionable and requires further consideration.},

The seed orchard consisted of 49 parents (clones). Cone-crop management included bloom delay and supplemental mass pollination (SMP) using 12 internal and 4 external pollen donors. A random sample of 801 bulk seeds was genotyped for both haploid megagametophyte and corresponding diploid embryo. Using the parental population's multilocus genotypes, full pedigree reconstruction generated all the information needed to estimate the maternal, paternal, and parental reproductive success, selfing, pollen contamination, and pollination success of the 4 external pollen donors.

abstract = {Seed orchards' parental reproductive success is often assessed through surveys of seed-and pollen-cone production (reproductive investment). Although the reliability of this approach has been questioned, its speed and ease made it the method of choice for providing approximate estimates for the genetic quality and quantity of seed orchard crops. In this study, reproductive investment data from various female and male phenotypic assessment methods from three seed orchards (lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex. Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.), Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco), and western larch (Larix occidentalis Nutt.)) were compared with reproductive success estimates based on DNA fingerprinting and parentage analyses. The use of reproductive investment as a proxy to reproductive success on estimating seed crop's volume genetic worth and diversity (measured by effective number of parents) was evaluated. Regression analyses indicated that the phenotypic assessment methods reflect the true parental reproductive success and that estimates of seed-and pollen-cone volume production appear to be the most appropriate indicators of female and male reproductive success, respectively. Although the best combination of female-male survey methods produced inflated effective number of parents estimates, the genetic worth estimates were similar to those based on DNA, highlighting their robustness to fertility variation assessment.},

The resultant table of variety-by-trial means is combined with tables from previous years to form the data for an overall mixed model analysis. Weights allow for the data being estimates with varying accuracy. In view of the predictive aim of the analysis, variety effects and interactions are regarded as random effects. Appropriate inferential tools have been developed to assist with interpretation of the results. Analyses must be conducted in a timely manner so that variety predictions can be published and disseminated to growers immediately after harvest each year.
